# Travel Advisor Web Application
Here's a neat app that you can use to look at restaurants, hotels, and attractions nearby. If you don't want to use your current location, just use the search box in the top right corner to explore wherever you'd like! I built this using [ReactJS](https://react.dev/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/hub/) (Travel Advisor API), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) (Maps + Places APIs), and [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/). Enjoy! --Peter

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
